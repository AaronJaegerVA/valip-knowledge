      The VA Logistics and Integration (VALIP) Platform design offers a comprehensive
      set of agile integration and messaging capabilities that provide service composition
      and orchestration, real-time messaging, data streaming, and API management.
      Combined with a sophisticated container platform and cloud native tool chain,
      it lets developers connect applications and data with a variety of internal and
      external systems across hybrid architectures. The VALIP Platform offers a variety
      of integration patterns natively to allow for flexible microservice composition.
      One of the core characteristics of the platform is the eventing backbone that is
      a fundamental component of the platform. Enabled by the platform’s inherent
      ability to scale capacity up and down dynamically based on utilization and
      policies, the inherent load latency problems common with most middleware
      solutions is eliminated.
